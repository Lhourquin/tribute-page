      <h2>"with great power comes great responsibility"
      </h2>
      <p>Peter Parker are the alone son of Richar and Mary Parker, his parent are killed while working undercover for the government6. Orphaned at the age of six, Peter is then entrusted to the care of his uncle and aunt, Bnejamin and May Parker. 
        Once a student, following an experiment he attends, he is bitten by a radioactive spider. This bite gives him super powers: he gets a strength and agility out of the ordinary, the ability to adhere to the walls and a "sense of spider" warning him of imminent danger.
        
        At first, he uses his newly acquired powers to earn money. But soon, a drama will change his life: he lets a thief escape while he could very easily stop, pretending that this is not his problem. Shortly after, his uncle Ben is killed by a burglar. Drunk with anger, Peter runs after the murderer who, once arrested, turns out to be the thief he did not deign to apprehend. From that moment, his vocation will be to fight against crime and to follow the adage: <strong>"with great power comes great responsibility"</strong> .
        
        To support himself and his aunt, in addition to his school fees, Peter must quickly find a job. Failing to join the team of Four Fantastic and possessing a camera, he has the idea to take pictures of himself in Spider-Man outfit, which he will then sell to different newspapers. On this occasion, he will be noticed by J. Jonah Jameson, the irascible owner and editor the Daily Bugle of New York, who will hire him as an independent photographer. The newspaper's staff, as well as its employees, will play a major role in his superhero career.
        
        His boss, J. Jonah Jameson, is the archetype of the envious: according to him, all the superheroes are at best the profiteers of glory, at worst criminals that must be unmasked in the eyes of the public. Spider-Man will be his favorite target; from the moment he rescues his son, John, Jonah Jameson considers that it is for the sole purpose of stealing the show.
        
        Peter Parker, as an adolescent in his skin, has a hard time preventing his secret identity from being exposed, because of pressure from public opinion, the police, his girlfriends Mary Jane Watson and Gwen Stacy, his aunt May cardiac and criminals he will meet during his adventures.
